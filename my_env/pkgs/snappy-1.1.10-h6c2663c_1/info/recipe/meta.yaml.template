  summary: A fast compressor/decompressor
  description: |
    Snappy is a compression/decompression library. It does not aim for maximum
    compression, or compatibility with any other compression library; instead, it
    aims for very high speeds and reasonable compression. For instance, compared to
    the fastest mode of zlib, Snappy is an order of magnitude faster for most
    inputs, but the resulting compressed files are anywhere from 20% to 100%
    bigger.
